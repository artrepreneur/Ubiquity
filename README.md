# Ubiquity
Agentic Payments Network

Ubiquity is a decentralized ecosystem designed to facilitate agentic payments, leveraging a dual-token system: XBU (a yield-bearing token) and USBX (a stablecoin pegged to USDT/USDC).

## Overview
The ICO phase deploys 7 smart contracts to:
- Pre-mint XBU tokens.
- Raise in USDT via presale with vesting (6-month cliff, 5% initial, 8% quarterly).
- Prepare USBX for pool funding.
- Allocate XBU for community rewards.


## Contracts
The ICO phase includes the following contracts:

| **Contract**            | **Purpose**                                                                 |
